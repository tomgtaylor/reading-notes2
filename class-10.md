# Class 10 - JS Debugging

## Troubleshooting

Types of error

**Syntax errors**: When spelling errors in your code cause the program to stop.

**Logic errors**: When the syntax right, but code gives incorrect results.

## How to open Devtools in your browser

Pull up Devtools on Windows:

    Keyboard: Ctrl + Shift + I

The Inspector: Dom explorer

    If you don't see the inspector,

    Tap/click the Inspector tab.
    In Internet Explorer, tap/click DOM Explorer, or press Ctrl + 1 .
    In Microsoft Edge, or Opera, tap/click Elements.
    In Safari, the controls are not so clearly presented, but you should see the HTML if you haven't selected something else to appear in the window. Press the Style button to see the CSS.

Available menu options vary among browsers

- Delete Node (sometimes Delete Element). Deletes the current element.
- Edit as HTML (sometimes Add attribute/Edit text). Lets you change the HTML and see the results on the fly. Very useful for debugging and testing.
- :hover/:active/:focus. Forces element states to be toggled on, so you can see what their styling would look like.
- Copy/Copy as HTML. Copy the currently selected HTML.
- Some browsers also have Copy CSS Path and Copy XPath available, to allow you to copy the CSS selector or XPath expression that would select the current HTML element.
