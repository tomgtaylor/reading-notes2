# Class 06 - JS Object Literals; The DOM

## What are Object Literals?

Object Literal: 

A data structure similar to arrays.
Like Arrays, they store values (strings, numbers, booleans, null, undefined)

A comma-separated list of name-value pairs inside of curly braces.

    let obejct = {
        name: "Tom", 
        age: 36,
        isEmployed: false,
    }
