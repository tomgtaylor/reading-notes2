# Class 14b - What Google Learned About Teams

---

This article examines team work productvity and behavioral traits, how varying teams are more effective, and why this is the case.

Google even came up with a "People Operations" department to observe and study people. This included observing who eat together, the frequency of how often they meet, the best traits that managers embody.

This also includes Google's "Project Aristotle," a study that gathered staticians, psychologists, sociologists, engineers, and researchers. The study initially struggled to find specifically what made a team successful, but the pattern of "group norms" kept popping up.

    Group Norms: 
    "the traditions, behavioral standards and unwritten rules that govern how we function when we gather: One team may come to a consensus that avoiding disagreement is more valuable than debate"

After a year, the researchers' conclusion was that understanding and influenging group norms was the key to improving Google's teams. They also found that "The researchers eventually concluded that what distinguished the ‘good’ teams from the dysfunctional groups was how teammates treated one another." In other words, the right norms determined team productivity.
